# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Jessica Doner, a grad student in Applied Mathematics at Eastern Washington University. I studied Computer Science, Data Science, and Cybersecurity as an undergrad and love working at the intersection of math, science, technology, and education. My goal is to create tools that are genuinely useful and make a difference.

# About Me

I want to teach, do research, and build tools that solve real problems. Iâ€™m especially focused on using technology to close equity gaps and make learning more accessible. Whether itâ€™s automating repetitive tasks, breaking down complicated ideas, or improving workflows, I enjoy coming up with creative solutions that actually help people.

In the long run, Iâ€™d love to focus my career on creating tools and scripts that make life easier for others. For me, making a positive impact is more important than chasing a paycheck.

# Languages I Use

These days, Python is my go-to for its flexibilityâ€”I use it for everything from data analysis to automation to experimenting with AI. I also have a soft spot for Java since itâ€™s where I first learned to code.
