### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Jessica Doner and I am a double major in computer science and data science at Eastern Washington University.

## What do I want to do?

- I would eventually like to teach and do research, and use my skills to help others. I am interested in combining my skills in math and my love of science with the tools and tech available to make things that will help close equity gaps and make the world a better place.
- I like to make scripts and automations and would like to make libraries of free tools to help people take advantage of things like OpenAI and other publically available APIs to improve their quality of life and accelerate learning and research. I'd ideally love to have a job where I just go around making scripts that make people's lives better. I am less concerned about money than I am with making an actual difference with the limited time I have to do so.

## Favorite languages

- I have always liked java, but have become fond of python lately because of how much you can do with it. I have been using python for math, data science, cybersecurity, and just for fun.

## Current and Future Projects
- I've been working on a set of discord bots that help teach people about math and cybersecurity in simple language without giving them the answer.
- I've also been making a suite of tools to help prep class materials to make teaching easier. It works by extracting text from pdfs with OCR and running sections through gpt-4 to generate supplemental material with slides, quiz questions, common misunderstanding / pitfalls, and other suggestions.
- I've been learning to start projects using chatGPT and trying to get better at making custom instructions and using the API
- Code not yet on github because its all still in pure "copied off of chatGPT" form, coming soon when cleaned up :)
