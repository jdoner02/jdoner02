# Hey, I'm Jessica

Graduate student instructor at Eastern Washington University. I teach [CSCD 210](https://jdoner02.github.io/cs-skill-tree/course-weekly.html?course=CSCD210) (intro Java) and I'm finishing my M.S. in Applied Mathematics with a focus on data science and operations research.

I like building models of systems—degree requirements, job markets, course prerequisites—and turning them into tools that help people navigate complexity. Most of my projects start as "I wish this existed" and end up on my [homepage](https://jdoner02.github.io).

## What I'm Working On

**[CS Skill Tree](https://jdoner02.github.io/cs-skill-tree/)** — Interactive visualization of EWU's CS curriculum. Prerequisites as a graph, progress tracking with local storage, week-by-week concept maps with mastery levels. Built with D3.js, Svelte, and TypeScript. 130+ unit tests because I actually wanted it to work.

**[Cybersecurity Job Scraper](https://jdoner02.github.io/cybersecurity-job-scraper/)** — Pulls federal cyber/AI postings from USAJOBS daily. Working toward O*NET integration so students can see which skills they're missing.

**[EWU Cyber Games](https://jdoner02.github.io/ewu-cyber-games-portal/)** — Vibe-coded with middle schoolers at GenCyber camp. Scrappy, rough around the edges, but teaches basic cyber concepts through brain-rot energy.

## The Research Direction

Operations research meets education: how do we model student pathways through curricula? How do we connect coursework to workforce skills in ways that are actually useful? How do we surface what students don't know they don't know?

I'm less interested in building things that are impressive and more interested in building things that are *useful*.
